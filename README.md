# Instagram-Photo-Projects

This repository will contain some of my projects where I try to work with Instagram data. 

Projects Include:

## Instagram Photo Quality Tester
A fun project to try to build a tool/app that will assess the quality of your photos in real time. 

Initially I was inspired by Corentin Dugue's blog post and github code to build the dataset: https://towardsdatascience.com/predict-the-number-of-likes-on-instagram-a7ec5c020203
His github repo is here: https://github.com/gvsi/instagram-like-predictor

But it seems hard to replicate from his github code so I will try InstaLoader, a package designed to make it easier to crawl data from insta: https://blog.floydhub.com/instagram-street-art/

Future work: I will try to learn web scraping using Selenium or other tool.

Other Ideas:
- Predict location that a travel photo was taken, just from the photo

Note: most of the data is not publicly available via API, it must be scraped from the web.
